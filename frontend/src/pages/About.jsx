        I'm Jasmin Hedlund â€” the creator behind this site. I've always been
        passionate about personal and professional growth, both in my own life
        and in others. I regularly use tools like this myself and know how
        powerful it can be to reflect, set clear intentions, and actually follow
        through. With The Intention Hub, I wanted to create a platform that
        makes that process feel simple, supported and meaningful, a space where
        more people can discover their potential and learn how to turn it into
        real, lasting action.
