      <Intro>
        <p>
          I'm Jasmin Hedlund â€” the creator behind this site. I've always been
          passionate about personal and professional growth, both in my own life
          and in others. I regularly use tools like this myself and know how
          powerful it can be to reflect, set clear intentions, and actually
          follow through. With The Intention Hub, I wanted to create a platform
          that makes that process feel simple, supported and meaningful, a space
          where more people can discover their potential and learn how to turn
          it into real, lasting action.
