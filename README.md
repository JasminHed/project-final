# Final Project
A personal and professional growth platform that combines meaningful intentions with SMART goals to help users achieve purposeful, actionable progress. Create intentions, set SMART goals, track your progress, and celebrate achievements with an engaging community feature.

## The Problem
I wanted to bridge the gap between meaningful purpose (intentions) and actionable steps (SMART goals). The approach was to create an educational onboarding experience then provides a interface for creating and managing their personal and professional development journey. Contribute to people creating and following thorugh on their dream life.
